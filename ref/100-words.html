                                    are the world leading award in Genetic Programming (GP). The paper describes the use of GP to evolve a general-purpose size-independent quantum algorithm to implement Shor&#x27;s Quantum Fourier Transform, the basis
                                    of Shor&#x27;s famous polynomial time factoring algorithm. This work demonstrates, for the first time, that automated computer-based techniques can be used to evolve significant quantum computing artefacts.&quot;</p>

                                <p>&quot;Workflow provenance captures information about an execution of a workflow, and queries over provenance data are widely used to clarify how the results of a workflow were obtained. This paper is significant because
                                    previous work on querying workflow provenance traversed the provenance data, whereas this approach only traverses the (much smaller) workflow definition, making relatively few and simple queries into the provenance
                                    data itself; an empirical evaluation reveals significant performance benefits. Included in public releases of the widely used Taverna workflow system.&quot;</p>

                                <p>&quot;The paper experimentally compares published load balancing techniques for parallel database query processing, identifies weaknesses in those techniques, and proposes a new method that addresses these weaknesses. This
                                    is significant because previously adaptive query load balancing techniques had only been compared with non- adaptive techniques and not with each other, and because the systematic evaluation in the paper provided new
                                    insights, for example by finding cases where adaptations reduced performance.&quot;</p>
                                <p>

                                <p>&quot;Techniques that support or automate the annotation of web services are important because such annotations are useful for service discovery and composition, but are tricky and time consuming to author manually. This
                                    paper is significant in supporting automatic derivation of dependable annotations, showing for the first time how workflow provenance can be used to propagate annotations between services. The empirical evaluation shows
                                    how the approach identified previously unidentified errors with manual annotations of e-Science services.&quot;</p>
