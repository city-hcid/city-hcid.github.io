                                        Each sub-panel will examine the submissions made in its <a href="https://www.ref.ac.uk/about/units-of-assessment/">UOA</a>, taking into account all the evidence presented. They will use their professional judgement to form an overall view about each submission. In doing so, the sub-panels will assess three distinct elements of each submission, against the following generic criteria:<sup><a href="https://www.ref.ac.uk/publications/draft-guidance-on-submissions-201801/">*</a></sup>

This element will carry a weighting of <strong>60 per cent</strong> in the overall outcome awarded to each submission.

This element will carry a weighting of <strong>25 per cent</strong>.

This element will carry a weighting of <strong>15 per cent</strong>.
