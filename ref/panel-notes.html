                                The Computer Science and Informatics UoA (11) sub-panel sets out some specific guidance in the REF "Panel Criteria and Working Methods" document. Below are some notes from this document.

Consequently, the sub-panel welcomes submissions containing interdisciplinary outputs that make contributions to other areas as well as computer science and informatics, though outputs that apply routine computational methods may be better returned elsewhere.</span></p>
