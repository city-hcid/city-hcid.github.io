                                The Computer Science and Informatics UoA (11) sub-panel sets out some specific guidance in the REF "Panel Criteria and Working Methods" document. Below are some notes from this document.

Consequently, the sub-panel welcomes submissions containing interdisciplinary outputs that make contributions to other areas as well as computer science and informatics, though outputs that apply routine computational methods may be better returned elsewhere.</span></p>

a. In assessing work as being four star (quality that is world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour), sub-panels will expect to see evidence of, or potential for, some of the following types of characteristics:
• agenda-setting
• research that is leading or at the forefront of the research area
• great novelty in developing new thinking, new techniques or novel results
• major influence on a research theme or field
• developing new paradigms or fundamental new concepts for research
• major changes in policy or practice
• major influence on processes, production and management
• major influence on user engagement.

b. In assessing work as being three star (quality that is internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance and rigour but which falls short of the highest standards
