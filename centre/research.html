                    <h3>Individual and Social Issues</h3>
                    <p class="ex-light">We study a wide variety of settings from the journalism, workplace to urban city farms. We aim to develop understandings of these settings and the unique issues and concerns that arise in them. In these studies, our emphasis is on
                        the role technology plays or might play, and where there is scope for rethinking the relations between the social and technical.</p>

                    <h3>Design Methods</h3>
                    <p class="ex-light">We experiment with adapting or inventing new design methods that respond to the specific settings or people we work with. Our research that represents dementia care through using the medium of comics illustrates the innovative and
                        exploratatory nature of this work.</p>
                    <p class="ex-light">Much of our work with design methods also aims to involve a wider cross-section of people in design through participatory methods. Our research with people with aphasia, for example, experiments with different co-design approaches
                        to give end-users greater influence over the design of their creative tools.</p>
