                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p class="reg">HCID is committed to providing a space for engaging, challenging, and enjoyable interactions. In doing so we take our responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of all participants very seriously.</p>
                        <p class="reg">
                        This code of conduct is in place to help meet that responsibility and sets out the expectations about conduct when hosting or participating in HCID activities. It extends to all activities held under the auspices of HCID including social events and the open day, and it applies to all colleagues, students, commercial booking individuals/organisations, and members of the public.</p>
                        <p class="reg">
                        This policy applies to all participants of events organised or hosted by HCID; both in person and virtual.</p>

                        <h3>Policy</h3>
                        <p class="reg">HCID is committed to making its activities productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, nationality or belief. </p>
                        <p class="reg">
                        We will not tolerate harassment in any form. </p>
                        <p class="reg">
                        All participants are expected to adhere to the following key principles during an in person and virtual event:</p>
                        <p class="reg">
                        Delegates are required to behave professionally - harassment and/or sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. 
                        <p class="reg"> Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. 
                        <p class="reg">It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion.</li>
                        <p class="reg">All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people from many different backgrounds. 
                        <p class="reg">
                        Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.</p>
                        <p class="reg">Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other delegates.
                        <p class="reg">
                        We may consider the following behaviours to be examples of harassment:
                            
                            Unwanted physical contact, including touching, pinching, pushing, grabbing, brushing past someone, invading their personal space; Continued suggestions for social activity after it had been made clear that such suggestions are unwelcome; Sending or displaying material that could reasonably be considered to be image-based abuse, or that may be considered to be offensive; Offensive or intimidating comments or gestures; insensitive jokes, pranks or ‘Banter’; Mocking, mimicking or belittling an individual’s disability; Racist, sexist, homophobic or ageist jokes, or derogatory or stereotypical remarks about a particular gender, or ethnic or religious group; Outing or threatening to out someone as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer (LGBTQ), or any other minority gender or sexual identity; Ignoring, shunning or deliberately excluding someone from a conversation or group.</p>
                        <h3>Breach of the code of conduct</h3>
                        <p class="reg">
                            Any delegate who wishes to report a violation of this policy is asked to speak, in confidence, to a member of the HCID staff.</p>
                        <p class="reg">
                            Delegates asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Anyone violating these rules may be asked to leave an event at the sole discretion of the organisers without a refund or removed from a virtual event.</p>
                        <p class="reg">
                            Legal action may be considered if a criminal offence is suspected and, if appropriate, the matter may be reported to the Police or other relevant authorities.</p>
