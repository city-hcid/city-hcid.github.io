                        <h2>A Working Charter</h2>
                        <p>The Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design—or as we like to call it HCID, is a collective and ongoing endeavour. Between us&#8212;through our design-based research, teaching and commercial work&#8212;we strive to make a difference. Focusing on the ways technologies entangle with the many and varied forms of life, we are spurred on by the possibilities for enlarging human capacity and creating the conditions for better ways of living together.</p>
                        <h3>Studies</h3>
                        <p>Looking outwards, to the worlds we engage with and study, our commitment is to improving people’s health, welfare, and security, and, at the same time, upholding rights to equity, fun, prosperity, fairness, justice and collective determination. Working inventively with empirical and human-centred design methods, our scholarly practices aim to deepen understandings of and sensitivities to these qualities while living (and dying) in technology-mediated worlds.</p>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>Our studies are distinguished by their commitment to designing interactions and experiences that enable such things as transparency, accessibility, and full representation. At the heart of the design research we do are participatory and co-design methods that redistribute the authority and power of who designs for whom, and reconfigure who decides what technology-mediated worlds are made possible. This is an additive project, where design becomes a way to bring more to the table.</p>
                        <h3>Intervention</h3>
                        <p>Co-designing interactions and experiences, we seek to intervene in the role technologies play in routine life. Our interventions unabashedly interweave with a politics of technology, aiming to resist totalising regimes and, instead, that create the conditions for more to happen and difference to flourish. Design intervention becomes the vehicle for co-imagining alternative worlds, for a collective adventure in making worlds otherwise.</p>
                        <h3>Care</h3>
                        <p>Among ourselves, our collective investment in studies, design and intervention are shaped by practices of care. We seek to build an environment in which a care for one another and the care for our labour isn’t diminished or erased in our scholarly work. Asking seriously “how do we work together?” demands an awareness of the precarity and unevenness of our relations, but also what more we are capable of. Our aim is to be responsive to and responsible for our practices of care, holding open the possibilities for working well together, and being alive to and affected by our collective world-making work.</p><br />
                        <p>Together, our Centre’s studies, design research, and interventionist orientation, and our collective practices of care,  set the stage for a transformative experiment. We believe in the modest but still generative capacities of technology to make worlds more livable - to enable greater capacities, to make possible human and nonhuman flourishing, to sew the seeds of plurality, to multiply and amplify voices, and so on — but we are steadfast in the commitments needed to learn again (and again) what that better is and how to get there.</p>
