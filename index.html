                                    The <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-human-computer-interaction-design" title="Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design | City, University of London">Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design</a> (HCID) has a tradition of hosting current and lively presentations and discussions as part of its seminar series. The talks are largely focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction" title="Humanâ€“computer interaction - Wikipedia">Human-Computer Interaction</a> and design related research, but also veer into related areas including discussions linked to methodology and theory, and related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies" title="Science and technology studies - Wikipedia">science and technology studies</a> (STS), cognition and behaviour, language and linguistics, and healthcare.

                                    As a centre, we try to host at least one external speaker a month and two talks/workshops given by internal researchers or research students. All are meant to be open to students, academics and interested members of the public.
